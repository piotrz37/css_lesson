# Sample HTML file for styling
This is a sample HTML file intended for learning basic styling. I will add to it
and make it easier to understand in time but for now it's just a simple
collection of text and a few images.

## How to use
Take the index.html file and add the CSS link to it. You'll see the background
turn red. Then you'll need to add styling based on the lesson.
